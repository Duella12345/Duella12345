### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building up my GitHub profile with data science projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Recommender Systems
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any of the presented data science projects and am open to other projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creative data visualisations to be displayed on a website
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything data science related!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love jellyfish and enjoy knitting, painting and paddleboarding when I am not coding.

### Background
In my current role I am a Software Engineer working with Java, Spring, Kafka, Neo4j, Docker and K8s to name a few things. I graduated from the Open University with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics and have worked on a number of data science projects as I rotated around BT on the Graduate Scheme.
 I enjoy problem solving and have a passion for data science and artificial intelligence. I am continually working to learn more in these areas. I have an analytical mindset and a sound mathematical and statistical knowledge gained from my mathematics degree. I have experience of gathering, analysing, and presenting data to managers and working with and presenting data as part of my degree.
